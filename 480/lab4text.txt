8.2) The knowledge base does not entail ∀x P(x). This is because given a model with domain {a, b, c}, when the KB is run with this domain, it will accept P(a) and P(b), but it does not entail P(c) which means that the KB does not entail all x in the model.

8.3) Yes the sentence is valid because when the inputs/terms are the same, the sentence is true. 

8.6) a. True, in 8.3 the right hand side was shown to be true (for all y there is at least one z (where the y term is the z term) where y = z) and the left hand side is true at least once due to the identity clause.
b. The sentence is a tautology so it must be true for all cases
c. Since x = x is always valid (identity properties) then this is true for al cases.

a. ∀s Breezy(s) => 3r Adjacent (r, s) ∧ Pit(r)
/3s Breezy(s) => ∀r Adjacent (r, s) ∧ /Pit(r)

These two are equivalent because these statements' existential quantifiers are the equivalent to each other in FOL.
When you take the negative of the "ALL" quantifier, you get NOT "THERE EXISTS" and when you take the negative of the
"THERE EXISTS" you get that statement is negative for ALL domain elements. Equation 8.4 is the same as this because
these two statements cover all domains, when it is not breezy and when it is breezy. 

b. 3s Pit(s) => ∀r Adjacent (r, s) ∧ Breezy(r) 
This statement is incomplete compared to Equation 8.4 because the KB doesn't know what happens when there isn't a pit at a square. So you must add the following axiom:
/3s Pit(s) => ∀r Adjacent (r, s) ∧ /Breezy(r) 
which covers the other case.
